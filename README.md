# MusicOn_Events
FinalAssignment

## Description

In this project, you are going to put everything that you have learned in React basics and advanced together to create your own event app. Your HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React skills that you have learned from all the course modules will finally all come together. 

For this project, we would like you to create an event app. The theme is up to you, but in our starter JSON file, we have added a few examples, so you have an idea of how the data structure should look like.

In short, the event dashboard app should display a list of events, add events, edit events, delete events, and show a more detailed page of an event. We will describe the required features in more detail below.

For this project, you can freely use any of the tools you learned in this and the previous module. Think of useReducer, Context, or component composition. It is not necessary to use all of them, and you can build the project without them as well. We have installed ChakraUI for the project so that you don’t have to focus on styling as much and also have a good-looking app for in your portfolio. However, you are free to create your own CSS files and your own UI components. 

## Requirements



The app contains a form.

You have used React Router.

### Events page


The page shows a list of all events that are retrieved from the back-end server with the following details: title, description, image, startTime, endTime and categories.


The user can click on an event that leads them to the ‘Event’ page using React Router.


There is a button that allows the user to add new events using a form. 


A query to add the event to the server is sent as well.


A succes message is displayed after successfully adding a new event.


You can search through the events based on the name of the event.


You can filter through the list/search results based on categories.


### Event page


The event page shows the following details:  title, description, image, startTime, endTime, categories and by who it’s created (display their name and image).


You can click on an edit button where the user can edit the details shown on the page. 


The back-end server data is updated after.


A succes or fail message is shown after a successful update.


You can click on a delete button to delete the event.


A delete query is sent to delete the data in the back-end.


A succes or fail message is shown after a successful delete.


### Extra Challenge



Make the app responsive.


Use Context to store the categories and users so that you only have to fetch them once.
